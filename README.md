 Computational Assignment for 44320

Results are reported in response.pdf. \
To replicate those figures:

1. Required packages are: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and numba(making this code slightly faster). \ 
2. Run 44320cc_2.py with python, then call 44320CA1.py to obtain 4 figures for problem 1 and 2. \
3. For large N, you may need to manually change N in 44320CA1.py to get the nice smooth curve. For $ N< 10000$, it would be fine.
