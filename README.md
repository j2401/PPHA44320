# PPHA44320 
 Computational Assignment for PPHA44320

Results are reported in response.pdf. 

To replicate those figures:
1. Required packages are: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and numba (making this code slightly faster). 
2. Run 44320cc_2.py with python first, then call 44320CA1.py to obtain 4 figures for problem 1 and 2. It should generate figures in the directory of source codes.
3. N could be manually modified in 44320CA1.py to get nice smooth curves. For N no larger than 10000, the performance would be fine.
4. Run 44320CA3 to get results for problem 3.

Since I'm using Windows, I didn't test them on MacOS. In case the scripts won't run, you might delete the savefig lines and location lines and simply use plt.show().
